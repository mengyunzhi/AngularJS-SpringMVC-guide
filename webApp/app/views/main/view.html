DocumentRoot is /usr/local/var/www.

The default ports have been set in /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf to 8080 and in

/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-ssl.conf to 8443 so that httpd can run without sudo.

To have launchd start httpd now and restart at login:

  brew services start httpd
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

  apachectl start

To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:

    LoadModule php5_module /usr/local/opt/php56/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

The php.ini file can be found in:

    /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/php.ini

✩✩✩✩ Extensions ✩✩✩✩

If you are having issues with custom extension compiling, ensure that you are using the brew version, by placing /usr/local/bin before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

      PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

PHP56 Extensions will always be compiled against this PHP. Please install them using --without-homebrew-php to enable compiling against system PHP.

✩✩✩✩ PHP CLI ✩✩✩✩

If you wish to swap the PHP you use on the command line, you should add the following to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile or your shell's equivalent configuration file:

  export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php56)/bin:$PATH"

To have launchd start homebrew/php/php56 now and restart at login:

  brew services start homebrew/php/php56
